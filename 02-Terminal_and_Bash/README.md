# 2. Terminal and Bash

Hi everyone! Welcome to the lecture/module on Terminal and Bash.

Here you will find the Jupyter Notebooks and PDFs for the module content and exercises, and a couple of directories that hold the resources for them.

For the smoothest learning experience, we recommend that you use the PDFs or Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) to follow along with the lecture and exercise instructions as needed, but **run all commands in a terminal** (i.e., not from inside the `.ipynb` files).

The material was originally prepared by Sebastian Urchs from our lab and has been previously taught by Jacob Sanz-Robinson. I'm Brent and will be covering "Terminal and Bash" and the HPC course this year. If you check out the QLS-612 YouTube channel you can watch Sebastian's original delivery of the lecture too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd10Wo5LQls&list=PLvBnRHmuiqY_6hfRmfF3468eBGnRqgW1r

Enjoy! :)
