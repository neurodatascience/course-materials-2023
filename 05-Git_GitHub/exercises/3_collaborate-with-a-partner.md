# Task 2: Collaborate with a partner

## Task
Practice collaborating with a partner on git and github. This includes opening an issue on their repo, forking it, making a change, and integrating that change with a pull request.

## Add to your drawing
As you go through these steps, add to your drawing the commands that move changes between different parts of the git project.

## If you need a hint
Look at [this version](https://github.com/koudyk/intro_git_github/blob/main/2-in-class-tutorial/HINTS__task-2_collaborate-with-a-partner.md) of this file to see which git command(s) to use for each step and which commands to put on your drawing.

## Steps
1. Find a partner

2. Tell each other the addresses of your github repos.

3. Decide with your partner what you'll change in each other's repo. E.g., you could change the file they uploaded or add a new file.

4. Open an issue on your partner's repo to say what you'll change.

5. Look at the issue your partner opened on your repo, and make a comment on it saying that they can go ahead and make the change.

6. Fork your partner's repo

7. Clone your fork of your partner's repo to your computer (*make sure you're not still in your own repo's folder*).

8. Create a branch to work on

9.  Move onto that branch

10. Make the change you agreed on

11. Stage the change

12. Commit the change, with the issue number in the commit message

13. Push the change to your fork of your partner's repository

14. Open a pull request

15. Review and merge each others' pull requests
