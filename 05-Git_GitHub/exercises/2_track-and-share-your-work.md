# Task 1: Track and share your own work

## Task
Create a local repository, link it to a remote repository on GitHub, and practice changing the repo and sharing your changes on GitHub.

## Add to your drawing
As you go through these steps, add to your drawing the commands that move changes between different parts of the git project.

## If you need a hint
Look at [this version](https://github.com/koudyk/intro_git_github/blob/main/2-in-class-tutorial/HINTS__task-1_track-and-share-your-work.md
) of this file to see which git command(s) to use for each step and which commands to put on your drawing.


## Steps
1. Make a directory somewhere on your machine. Make its name unique so there isn't another with the same name on GitHub.

2. Change into the directory

3. Initialize a git repository

4. Make a python file with some contents

5. (optional) Try inspecting what git is/isn't tracking

6. Stage the change

7. Commit the change

8. Make a PUBLIC repository on GitHub with the same name (if it's private, you won't be able to do the collaboration task; you can delete it afterwards).

9. Once you create your repo on GitHub, it will bring you to a page with a heading *"... or push an existing repository from the command line"*. Use this code to tell git the shortname and address of your remote repository, rename your principal branch to 'main', and push your local repo contents to the remote repo.

10. If you have time before the next task, repeat these steps a few times:
      - Change your file
      - Stage the change
      - Commit the change
      - Push the change to GitHub
