# # Predicting site from fMRI: cross-validation and dimensionality reduction.
#
# Here we consider the same data and prediction task as in the tutorial of
# Machine Learning part 1 of the QLS course.
#
# We have some fMRI time series, that we use to compute a connectivity matrix
# for each participant. We use the connectivity matrix values as our input
# features to predict to which site the participant belongs.
#
# As in Part 1, we classify participants using a logistic regression. However
# we make several additions.
#
# ## Pipeline
#
# We use scikit-learn's `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline`, that enables chaining
# several transformations into a single scikit-learn estimator (an object with
# a `fit` method). This avoids dealing with the connectivity feature extraction
# separately and ensures everything is fitted on the training data only --
# which is crucial here because we will add scaling a dimensionality reduction
# step with Principal Component Analysis.
#
# ## Scaling
#
# We add scaling of the input features using scikit-learn's StandardScaler,
# which removes the mean and scales the features to unit variance. This helps
# the logistic regression solver converge faster and often improves
# performance.
#
# ## Dimensionality Reduction
#
# We also consider a pipeline that reduces the dimension of input features with
# PCA, and compare it to the baseline logistic regrssion. One advantage is that
# the pipeline that uses PCA can be fitted much faster.
#
# ## Cross-validation
#
# In part 1 we fitted one model and evaluated it on a held-out test set. Here,
# we will use scikit-learn's `cross_validate` to perform K-Fold
# cross-validation and get a better estimate of our model's generalization
# performance. This allows comparing logistic regression with and without PCA,
# as well as a naive baseline.
#
# Moreover, instead of the plain `LogisticRegression`, we use scikit-learn's
# `LogisticRegressionCV`, which automatically performs a nested
# cross-validation loop on the training data to select the best hyperparameter.
#
# We therefore obtain a typical supervised learning experiment, with learning
# pipelines that involve chained transformations, hyperparameter selection, a
# cross-validation, and comparison of several models and a baseline.
#
# ## Exercises
#
# Read, understand and run this script. `load_connectivity_data` loads the data
# and returns the matrices `X` and `y`. `prepare_pipelines` returns a
# dictionary whose values are scikit-learn estimators and whose keys are names
# for each estimator. All estimators are instances of scikit-learn's
# `Pipeline`, and the first step is always connectivity feature extraction with
# nilearn's `ConnectivityMeasure`.
#
# At the moment `prepare_pipelines` only returns 2 estimators: the logistic
# regression and a dummy estimator. Add a third estimator in the returned
# dictionary, which contains a dimensionality reduction step: a PCA with 20
# components. To do so, add a `sklearn.decomposition.PCA` as the second step of
# the pipeline. Note 20 is an arbitrary choice; how could we set the number of
# components in a principled way? What is the largest number of components we
# could ask for?
# Answer: include it in grid search, 80 (rank of X_train)
#
# There are 111 regions in the atlas we use to compute region-region
# connectivity matrices: the output of the `ConnectivityMeasure` has
# 111 * (111 - 1) / 2 = 6105 columns. If the dataset has 100 participants, What
# is the size of the coefficients of the logistic regression? of the selected
# (20 first) principal components? of the output of the PCA transformation (ie
# the compressed design matrix)?
# Answer: 6105 coefficients + intercept; principal components: 20 x 6105;
# compressed X: 100 x 20.
#
# Here we are storing data and model coefficients in arrays of 64-bit
# floating-point values, meaning each number takes 64 bits = 8 bytes of memory.
# Approximately how much memory is used by the design matrix X? by the
# dimensionality-reduced data (ie the kept left singular vectors of X)? by the
# principal components (the kept right singular vectors of X)?
# Answer: X: 4,884,000 B, compressed X: 16,000 B, V: 976,800 B
# (+ 96 bytes for all for the array object)
#
# As you can see, in this script we do not specify explicitly the metric
# functions that are used to evaluate models, but rely on scikit-learn's
# defaults instead. What metric is used in order to select the best
# hyperparameter? What metric is used to compute scores in `cross_validate`?
# Are these defaults appropriate for our particular situation?
# Answer: sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score for both, yes
#
# We do not specify the cross-validation strategy either. Which
# cross-validation procedure is used in `cross_validate`, and by the
# `LogisticRegressionCV`? Are these choices appropriate?
#
# ## Additional exercises (optional)
#
# Try replacing the default metrics with other scoring functions from
# scikit-learn or functions that you write yourself. Does the relative
# performance of the models change?
#
# Specify the cross-validation strategy explicitly, possibly choosing a
# different one than the default.
#
# Add another estimator to the options returned by `prepare_pipelines`, that
# uses univariate feature selection instead of PCA.
#
# What other approach could we use to obtain connectivity features of a lower
# dimension?
# Answer: use an atlas with less regions
