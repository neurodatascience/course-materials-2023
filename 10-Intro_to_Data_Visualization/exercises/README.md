# Exercises



## Data
Most of the date you will need is in the `data` folder.
Some of the data will be downloaded when you run the final exercise. But it shouldn't take more than a few minutes, since we will only download data for 2 participants.

## Cheat sheets
- [matplotlib cheatsheet](https://matplotlib.org/cheatsheets/_images/cheatsheets-1.png) (chart types, etc)
- [matplotlib cheatsheet by NumFocus](https://matplotlib.org/cheatsheets/_images/cheatsheets-1.png) (has more colormaps)
- [Anatomy of a figure](https://matplotlib.org/stable/_images/sphx_glr_anatomy_001_2_0x.png)

## Examples
- [code that made the "Anatomy of a Figure" figure]()https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/showcase/anatomy.html
- [example code that I showed in the lecture](../lectures/example_code/)


## Hints
In the "hints" folder, you will find a few files for each exercise

If you are stuck, start with HINT 1 before moving onto the others.

There's no shame in needing help (we all were beginners once).
But pushing yourself to remember things and look them up (e.g., in the documentation) will help you learn how to help yourself.
