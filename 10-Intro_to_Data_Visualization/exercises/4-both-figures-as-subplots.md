# Exercise 4: Put both your figures in subplots in the same figure

## Goal
In the last two exercises, you created a plot of summary statistics and a corresponding plot with all the participant data available.
In this exercise, you will put both of those figures in the same subplot.

## Data
- `ABIDE_paper_table_1.png` contains an image of the table with the summary statistics
- `Phenotypic_V1_0b_preprocessed1.csv` contains the full participant-level data from the ABIDE dataset
- `ABIDE_LEGEND_V1.02.pdf` contains a table with the meanings of the column names in the .csv

## Task
1. Combine your code from the past two tasks so they're in the same figure, in separate subplots.
