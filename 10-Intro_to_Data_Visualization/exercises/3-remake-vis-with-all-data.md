# Exercise 3: Remake your visualization with all the data
(not just the summary statistics)

## Goal
In the last two exercises, you planned and created a figure using summary statistics from a table.
In this exercise, you will re-design and encode your figure from exercise 1, with all the participant-level data.

## Data
- `Phenotypic_V1_0b_preprocessed1.csv` contains the full participant-level data from the ABIDE dataset
- `ABIDE_LEGEND_V1.02.pdf` contains a table with the meanings of the column names in the .csv

## Task
1. Plan whether/how to change your figure
2. Write a python script to create the figure
