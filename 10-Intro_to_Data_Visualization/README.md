# Introduction to Data Visualization

Welcome! Data visualization is an essential skill for scientists.

At the grad student level, you're probably already familiar with basic plots (e.g., bar plot vs pie chart), as well as types of data (e.g, ordered vs categorical).

With that in mind, I hope to take you a bit deeper into the technicalities of planning and executing and effictive Figure.


## Lecture recordings

2. [Part 2: Encoding]()

## Slides
The slides for each lecture are in this folder.
I also included versions with my notes to myself, in case those are helpful to you.

## Lecture code
The code I used in the lectures are in the folder `lecture code`.

## Exercises
The exercises and most of the data you'll need are in the `exercises` folder. Some of the data will be downloaded when you run the final exercise. But it shouldn't take more than a few minutes, since we will only download data for 2 participants.
