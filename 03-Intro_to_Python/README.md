# 3. Introduction to Python

Welcome to **Module 3: Introduction to Python**! üêç

In this module, we will cover the fundamentals of the Python programming language: syntax, data structures, functions, and more. Lecture material (an interactive notebook) can be found in `lecture-content`, and I have posted tutorial exercises in the `exercises` folder. Exercise solutions will be posted at a later date in the course. All the material for this module is modified from last year's version of the course, where the module was taught by Jacob Sanz-Robinson.

A pre-recorded lecture (taught by Jacob) covering mostly the same material can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ml6VkmtLXpA).
