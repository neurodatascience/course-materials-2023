# 11. High Performance Computing

In this lecture we will cover the basic structure and purpose of a high
performance computer (HPC) and how it differs for working on a personal computer
(PC). Then we will discuss how performing an analysis on an HPC differs from
performing an analysis on a PC like you have typically experienced. Finally, we
will go over a basic working example so you can create the files and structures
necessary to run your own analyses on an HPC system.
